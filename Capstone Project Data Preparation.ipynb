    "## Introduction\n",
    "For my Capstone Project, I want to analyze how the different aspects of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) economies distinguished these countries as the strongest emerging markets in the twentieth century. These economies have the potential to become the world's fastest economies with their low labor costs, locational advantages, and abundant natural resources, yet why haven't they? Did political instability cause economic struggle in these countries, or are there underlying reasons in the data that suggest a particular industry underperformed? Using data science techniques, I will analyze the different industries that contribute the most to the BRICS economy overtime. Further, I want to analyze how different aspects of the BRICS economy contributed to their overall GDP and Growth per Year. Through machine learning techniques, I want to answer why some of these countries underperformed, or the underlying cause as to why they were not able to meet expectations."

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "In order to analyze the BRICS datasets, first I will need to prepare the data and then clean it appropriately. I will look into the five datasets downloaded from Kaggle, `https://www.kaggle.com/docstein/brics-world-bank-indicators` and understand what the columns are representing. For each dataset, I will analyze what the datatypes of the columns are and check for number of null values. Depending on how many null values and the proportion of data they account for, I will decide whether to drop them or impute them. Further, I plan on merging the datasets and rotating them in order to achieve a cumulative dataset that will allow me to conduct different machine learning models. This rotated dataset will have the rows as the BRICS countries and the features as the different Series in each dataset. I will also need to create some features that will help me in my analysis such as a Increase/Decrease per Year, Percent Growth, and Total GDP. First, in order to construct the data in this way, I must read in these files. Below, I have downloaded the necessary packages to prepare and clean the datasets."

With only four features in the dataset after dropping, I plan on pivoting the table and making each unique SeriesName a feature for analysis with the rows as the Country and Year. In theory, this should make the dataset more applicable for machine learning models. Further, we can see that there are currently three features that are non-numeric, which will have to be addressed in the cleaning. Before, pivoting the table, I plan on understanding and preparing the data more by checking for null values and duplicated rows in each dataset. "

    "We can see that there is a high proportion of null values and duplicated rows in the dataset. Prior to downloading this data, I noticed that the Kaggle data originally pulled from The World Bank's DataBank. This database contains many databases that encompass different development indicators, growing industries, and statistical data related to population dynamics. Exploring these databases, I realized that for many of the indicators, the time series had a major impact on how many values were represented in the data. Considering this fact, I decided for my analysis of BRICS economies, I would focus on the time period starting in 1995 to 2018, as the database has not been updated for 2019 yet. I believe the reason The World Bank does not release current data and the datasets have many missing values is due to the inability to maintain a flow of survey data from some countries every year. For more info on why there are NaN values The World Bank explains the reason on this webpage, `https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/191133-why-are-some-data-not-available`. Before, removing the NaN values and duplicated columns, I will pivot the table in order to see how the number of rows and features change. "

    "As guessed, the Private dataset contains less features than the other datasets as the number of values was significantly lower. An important note is the fact that there are only 230 rows compared to the other 3 dataframes. This suggests that there are 20 rows of missing data for a specific time series somewhere in the dataframe. I will need to find these values and understand why they are excluded from the dataset. When combining all the dataframes into one, I will need to understand which features are relevant and contain information for the time period I plan to analyze. Finally, I will prepare and gain an understanding of the Health dataset."
