Capstone Project: BRICS Analysis

This text file is provided for understanding how to run the 4 different ipynb notebooks and the relevant datasets.
My Capstone was done in an iterative fashion and altering the datasets multiple times. The order that the notebooks should be opened and run are:

	1. Capstone Project Data Preparation
	2. Capstone Project Cleaning
	3. Capstone Project EDA
	4. Capstone Project Modeling

If the notebooks are run in this order, the code should work and you will be able to see my Capstone Project and future plans.
I have also included a Data folder with all the datasets that were used, created, and not used.
Since I created and altered many datasets during my Capstone, there are some datasets that were not used for the analysis.
I believe I have included all the datasets and the final one with the relevant features "df_answer."

On a side note, the 2nd notebook seems to take a long time to open and when I open it on my computer, Anaconda slows down considerably.
Let me know if there are any problems and I hope I have included all the material needed for my Capstone Project.

Sincerely,
Ryan Kidd
